title: Workshop Overview
---

## Objectives

- Learn how centroid based clustering works using example datasets.
  - 3D Synthetic data
  - Model data
  - Single Geophysical survey
  - Time separate Satellite data
  - Combining remote sensing data
- Provide Google Colab based code for performing clustering.
- Highlight main issue with clustering is decision as to the number of clusters to use.
- Show success of MCASD on example datasets for determining the appropriate number of clusters.
- Opportunity to try out simple clustering on participants datasets.

## What will be the public experience?

We expect around 10 - 15 people. It is expected that the audience will not have experience with clustering before and only limited coding experience.

Therefore, all code will be provided with audience briefly shown how to use Google Colab environment to run code.

## Material

Each audience member should either have their own laptop or access to a computer/screen to follow the workshop. The workshop will be a follow along type workshop where participants follow along the workshop leader who will run the code on a projector screen also.
Workshop leader will also have a PowerPoint presentation to explain clustering theory and show background and context to data, in addition to results generated during the workshop.

Workshop will require:

- Each member to set up or have access to a Google Account to run Google Colab
- Each member should have access to a laptop or shared laptop screens to follow along.
- Workshop leader will require a projector screen.

## Plan

The workshop is divided into five distinct parts.

Each part is run consecutively with a dedicated Google Colab notebook.
On Thursday 1st Feb, we have 4h in the afternoon and 2h in the morning on Friday 2nd.

### Part 1: Introduction to Google Colab and Clustering

Thursday 1st Feb: 14:00 – 14:30

- Making sure everyone has Google Account and access to Google Colab notebook.
- Introduction presentation:
  - Overview of the Workshop and workshop leader
  - Introduction to centroid based clustering
  - Introduction to Randomised 3D Dataset
- Running of Google Colab code in steps to cluster the Introduction to Randomised 3D Dataset.

### Part 2: Introduction to Centroid Clustering using Rice Grain Model

Thursday 1st Feb: 14:30 – 15:15

- Making sure everyone has Google Account and access to Google Colab notebook.
- Introduction presentation:
  - Introduction to Rice Grain Model
  - Introduction to MCASD
- Running of Google Colab code in steps to cluster the Rice Grain Model

### Part 3: Using Centroid Clustering on real geophysical data (EMI data)

Thursday 1st Feb: 15:15 – 16:15

- Presentation
  - Giving background on the dataset presented (EMI data from Ireland)
  - Showing results from this real-world example and how clustering aided analysis (Paper reference)
- Running of Google Colab code in follow along steps to clustering real work EMI data

### Part 4: Using Centroid Clustering to compare data from two surveys (Satellite S2 data).

Thursday 1st Feb: 16:15 – 17:15 (Possibility to overlap with next session)

- Presentation
  - Giving background on the dataset presented (Optical Satellite data from Irish Peatland site over two consecutive years)
  - Showing results from this real-world example and how clustering aided analysis (Paper reference)
- Running of Google Colab code in follow along steps to clustering real-world satellite data, comparing results from two different years.

### Part 5: Using Centroid Clustering to combine two remotely sensed datasets (Satellite S2 and Airborne Radiometric data)

Thursday 2nd Feb: 11:00 – 12:45

- Presentation
  - Giving background on the dataset presented (Optical Satellite data from Part 3 and Airborne Radiometric data)
  - Showing results from this real-world example and how clustering aided analysis (Paper reference)
- Running of Google Colab code in follow along steps to clustering real-world satellite data, combining results from two different survey platforms

### Part 6 (Optional): Try Clustering your own data.

Thursday 2nd Feb: 11:00 – 12:45

If anyone gets through the material and wants to try clustering their own data (if they have any to try it on) this can be done in this time slot also.
